# python_folium_airportmap
Python project using airport data with folium

Data Visualization of airport information from csv file,
originally intending to generate a map using folium with US based airports from the file,
however as the amount of data was too large to generate the map online,
I generated the map with China and Japan-based airports from the csv file
using Python, pandas and folium.
